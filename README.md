# challenge10-OOP

## Description

This program was created with the intention of better understanding object oriented programming and using fs to generate a file from user input. 
A challenge encountered in creating this was keeping variable names consistent across files and made for a majority of my debugging process. In the future,
I will make sure to be careful and consistent in my work and naming schemes, as it took a majority of this project time.
